## Platforms

- [Keep](https://github.com/keephq/keep) - The open-source AIOps and alert management platform.
- [FireHydrant](https://firehydrant.com/) [closed-source] - FireHydrant is a full-cycle incident management platform that makes your incidents less painful. From automating toil to efficiently assembling the right teams, standardizing communications, facilitating better retrospectives, and gathering metrics, FireHydrant helps organizations improve their reliability and resilience.
- [Incident.io](https://incident.io/) [closed-source] - The all-in-one AI platform for on-call, incident response, and status pages—built for fast-moving teams.
- [Rootly](https://rootly.com/) [closed-source] - Like having your most experienced engineer in every incident.
- [Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) - A task management system for AI-driven development with Claude, designed to work seamlessly with Cursor AI.

## Protocol

 - [A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) - An open protocol enabling communication and interoperability between opaque agentic applications.
 - [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
 - [AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui) - AG-UI is a lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes how AI agents connect to user-facing applications. Built for simplicity and flexibility, it enables seamless integration between AI agents, realtime user context, and user interfaces.
 - [mcp-ui](https://github.com/idosal/mcp-ui) - mcp-ui brings interactive web components to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Deliver rich, dynamic UI resources directly from your MCP server to be rendered by the client. Take AI interaction to the next level!

## Gateway

- [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) - Call all LLM APIs using the OpenAI format [Bedrock, Huggingface, VertexAI, TogetherAI, Azure, OpenAI, Groq etc.]

## Observability

- [OneUptime](https://github.com/oneuptime/oneuptime) - The Complete Open-Source Observability Platform.
- [LangFuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) - Langfuse is an open source LLM engineering platform. It helps teams collaboratively develop, monitor, evaluate, and debug AI applications. Langfuse can be self-hosted in minutes and is battle-tested.
- [LogFire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) - See exactly what your Python apps and LLMs are doing, while you code. Built on open standards (OpenTelemetry), Pydantic Logfire offers native AI integrations—from LLM API calls to agent frameworks. Plus comprehensive observability for any workload, AI or not.
- [Mezmo](https://www.mezmo.com/) [closed-source] - Mezmo is a log ingestion and aggregation tool that uses ML to correlate and de-duplicate logs. With the explosion in observability data, having a tool that is able to make that data useful and actionable to teams is key.
- [Causely](https://www.causely.io/) [closed-source] - Causely takes a unique approach of using a causal model to attempt to turn observability data and alerts into specific root causes.

## MCP

- [MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) - MCP Toolbox for Databases is an open source MCP server for databases. It enables you to develop tools easier, faster, and more securely by handling the complexities such as connection pooling, authentication, and more.


## Experts

- [Freelens](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens) and [Freelens AI](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens-ai-extension) - Freelens is a free and open-source user interface designed for managing Kubernetes clusters. Freelens AI is an extension for Freelens that brings AI capabilities directly into your workflow.
- [k8sgpt](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt) - k8sgpt is a tool for scanning your Kubernetes clusters, diagnosing, and triaging issues in simple English.

## SRE Agent

- [Parity](https://www.tryparity.com/) [closed-source] - Parity is the AI SRE for incident response.

## CI/CD


## Agent

- [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) - PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.
- [Atomic Agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents) - The Atomic Agents framework is designed around the concept of atomicity to be an extremely lightweight and modular framework for building Agentic AI pipelines and applications without sacrificing developer experience and maintainability. 
- [Griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape) - Griptape is a Python framework designed to simplify the development of generative AI (genAI) applications. 



## Others
