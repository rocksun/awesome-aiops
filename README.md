## Platforms

- [Keep](https://github.com/keephq/keep) - The open-source AIOps and alert management platform.
- [FireHydrant](https://firehydrant.com/) [closed-source] - FireHydrant is a full-cycle incident management platform that makes your incidents less painful. From automating toil to efficiently assembling the right teams, standardizing communications, facilitating better retrospectives, and gathering metrics, FireHydrant helps organizations improve their reliability and resilience.
- [Incident.io](https://incident.io/) [closed-source] - The all-in-one AI platform for on-call, incident response, and status pages—built for fast-moving teams.
- [Rootly](https://rootly.com/) [closed-source] - Like having your most experienced engineer in every incident.


## Gateway

- [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) - Call all LLM APIs using the OpenAI format [Bedrock, Huggingface, VertexAI, TogetherAI, Azure, OpenAI, Groq etc.]

## Observability

- [LangFuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) - Langfuse is an open source LLM engineering platform. It helps teams collaboratively develop, monitor, evaluate, and debug AI applications. Langfuse can be self-hosted in minutes and is battle-tested.
- [LogFire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) - See exactly what your Python apps and LLMs are doing, while you code. Built on open standards (OpenTelemetry), Pydantic Logfire offers native AI integrations—from LLM API calls to agent frameworks. Plus comprehensive observability for any workload, AI or not.
- [Mezmo](https://www.mezmo.com/) [closed-source] - Mezmo is a log ingestion and aggregation tool that uses ML to correlate and de-duplicate logs. With the explosion in observability data, having a tool that is able to make that data useful and actionable to teams is key.
- [Causely](https://www.causely.io/) [closed-source] - Causely takes a unique approach of using a causal model to attempt to turn observability data and alerts into specific root causes.
